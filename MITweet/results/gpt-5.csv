0,"The text is a critique of Donald Trump for not publicly honoring a slain Capitol Hill police officer (e.g., by mentioning him or lowering the White House flag). It reflects disapproval toward Trump's conduct and questions support for him within law enforcement. However, it does not express positions on the specified ideological dimensions: it does not address ownership models (I1), state structure (I2), economic systems (I3), equality frameworks (I4), cultural/ethical issues like sexual morality (I5), church-state relations (I6), collectivism vs individualism (I7), foreign policy scope (I8), international use of force (I9), strategies for social change (I10), theories of justice (I11), or a clear stance on personal rights vs social responsibility (I12).

1,"The text comments on a UN General Assembly/Security Council draft resolution about the Russia–Ukraine conflict, criticizing it for focusing on blame rather than ending the war, and affirming that Bangladesh wants peace. This engages directly with international institutions and multilateral diplomacy, indicating a globalist orientation (I8). The explicit preference for peace over warfare signals a pacifist stance (I9). No positions are expressed about ownership of production, state structure, economic systems, equality, ethics, church-state relations, cultural values, methods of social change, justice frameworks, or personal rights, so those dimensions are unrelated.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]"
2,"The text criticizes progressive 'identity politics' and the slogan 'no one is illegal,' blaming such views for a 'BidenBorderCrisis.' This indicates a restrictionist immigration stance emphasizing rule of law and enforcement over expansive rights claims for migrants. That maps to Procedural Justice (I11: favoring rule-based enforcement) and Social Responsibility (I12: prioritizing duties/order over individual rights claims). The explicit rejection of 'identity politics' suggests opposition to group-based collectivist framing, aligning with Individualism (I7). Other dimensions (I1, I2, I3, I4, I5, I6, I8, I9, I10) are not directly addressed by the text.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]"
3,"The text is a factual/critical statement about Russia’s commodity exports and the EU’s dependence on Russian energy, noting revenue flowing to Putin. It does not advocate policy changes or value positions on ownership, state structure, economic planning, equality, ethics, religion-state relations, culture, militarism, social change strategy, justice, or individual rights. It touches on international interdependence (foreign trade) but without endorsing either globalism or isolationism, making it related yet neutral on Diplomatic Strategy (I8). All other dimensions are unrelated.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
4,"The text is a personal statement about the speaker's experiences with men and a personal decision to stop having sex. It does not express positions on public ownership vs private ownership (I1), state structure (I2), economic systems (I3), equality frameworks (I4), church-state relations (I6), collectivism vs individualism as a societal value (I7), foreign policy (I8), use of military force (I9), paths of social change (I10), justice frameworks (I11), or societal emphasis on rights vs responsibilities (I12). While it references sexual behavior, it does not advocate a societal ethical stance (e.g., promoting sexual liberation or moral restriction) and thus does not clearly map to Ethical Pursuit (I5). Therefore, all dimensions are marked as unrelated.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
5,"The text is a sarcastic critique of bipartisanship during a crisis and uses a religious phrase rhetorically. It does not convey explicit positions on any of the listed ideological dimensions: no stance on public vs private ownership (I1), central vs federal power distribution (I2), command vs market economy (I3), outcome vs opportunity equality (I4), ethical liberalism vs conservatism (I5), church-state separation vs unity (I6; the prayer is rhetorical, not a policy stance), collectivism vs individualism (I7), globalism vs isolationism (I8), militarism vs pacifism (I9), revolutionism vs reformism (I10), result vs procedural justice (I11), or social responsibility vs individual rights (I12).

6,"The text focuses on advocacy for women’s equality and human rights, plus support services for abuse survivors. It does not address economic systems (I1, I3), state structure (I2), church–state relations (I6), cultural value orientation (I7), foreign policy (I8), militarism/pacifism (I9), or economic equality specifically (I4). It implies a reformist strategy through education and advocacy rather than radical upheaval (I10=Reformism). The emphasis on equality and fair treatment aligns with a result-oriented justice perspective (I11=Result Justice). The explicit mention of human rights places emphasis on protecting individual rights (I12=Individual Right). Ethical orientation toward progressive social change is suggested but without explicit stances on sexual morality issues listed (I5 considered related but neutral/unspecified).","[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 3]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 3]"
7,"The text expresses a pro-life stance tied to traditional marriage and family norms. This directly maps to Ethical Pursuit (I5) as ethical conservatism, favoring restrictions on abortion and endorsing traditional family values. It also emphasizes communal/familial norms over individual autonomy, indicating Collectivism (I7). Furthermore, it prioritizes social duties and protecting unborn life over individual reproductive choice, reflecting Social Responsibility (I12). While the Supreme Court is mentioned, the text does not address church-state unity (I6), legal procedural fairness vs outcomes (I11), methods of social change (I10), or any positions on economic systems (I1, I3, I4), state structure (I2), foreign policy (I8), or military force (I9); these are unrelated.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
8,"The text criticizes Russian state TV for using Tucker Carlson clips to spread disinformation about Ukraine. This is mainly about international relations and information warfare, touching on Diplomatic Strategy (I8) insofar as it references cross-border propaganda and alignment with Ukraine against Russian narratives. However, it does not explicitly advocate for global engagement or avoidance of entanglements, so the stance is related but not clearly globalist or isolationist (Center). All other dimensions (I1, I2, I3, I4, I5, I6, I7, I9, I10, I11, I12) are not addressed: there is no discussion of ownership models, state structure, economic systems or equality, ethical/moral norms, church-state relations, individual vs collective values, military force preferences, approaches to social change, conceptions of justice, or rights vs responsibilities.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]"
9,"The text is a factual, historical note about the 1974 ERISA law, listing what it did (federal regulation/insurance of private pensions; creation of tax-deductible IRA and 401(k)). It contains no evaluative or prescriptive language indicating support or opposition to any ideological stance. While it references federal regulation and private retirement accounts, these mentions are descriptive rather than advocacy and do not convey positions on capitalism vs. socialism (I1), centralism vs. federalism (I2), command vs. market economy (I3), or any other listed dimensions. Therefore, all dimensions are unrelated.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
10,"The text is a historical description highlighting past restrictions on women's rights in the UK: abortion was illegal until the 1960s, contraception was heavily restricted until 1967, and women couldn’t open bank accounts independently until 1975. This directly touches Ethical Pursuit (I5) because it references abortion and contraception—issues at the core of ethical liberalism vs conservatism—but the text itself does not explicitly endorse either liberalization or restriction, making it related but neutral. It also relates to Personal Right (I12) by foregrounding individual autonomy (women opening bank accounts in their own right), again without a clear normative stance, so it’s related but neutral. Other dimensions (political regime, state structure, economic orientation/equality, church-state relations, cultural value, diplomacy, militarism, social development strategy, justice orientation) are not addressed explicitly and remain unrelated.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3]"
11,"The text advocates that only Americans should receive American vaccines and uses hashtags emphasizing border security and illegal immigration. This reflects a nationalist, inward-focused stance: related to I8 (Diplomatic Strategy), it suggests avoiding international distribution/entanglement and prioritizing domestic needs, aligning with Isolationism (Right). It also bases allocation on membership in the national collective (Americans), prioritizing the in-group over universal individual claims, which aligns with Collectivism in I7 (Left on that dimension). Other dimensions (I1 Political Regime, I2 State Structure, I3 Economic Orientation, I4 Economic Equality, I5 Ethical Pursuit, I6 Church-State Relations, I9 Military Force, I10 Social Development, I11 Justice Orientation, I12 Personal Right) are not explicitly addressed by the statement.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0]"
12,"The text uses pejorative phrasing like ""pro-abort"" and criticizes abortion rights activism, aligning with Ethical Conservatism (I5 Right). It also dismisses protest tactics around a justice’s home and the Supreme Court as ineffective (""as useful as invisible cuffs""; ""Enough is enough""), signaling opposition to direct, disruptive action and a preference for non-activist, incremental approaches—consistent with Reformism (I10 Right). The text does not address ownership of production (I1), state structure (I2), economic decision-making (I3), equality frameworks (I4), church-state relations (I6), cultural individualism/collectivism (I7), foreign policy (I8), militarism (I9), justice decision standards (I11), or a general rights-versus-responsibilities framing (I12).","[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 2]"
13,"The text expresses dissatisfaction with the current U.S. President’s performance during COVID-19 and a desire for a new president. It does not articulate positions on public vs. private ownership (I1), central vs. federal power distribution (I2), command vs. market economy (I3), outcome vs. opportunity equality (I4), liberal vs. conservative ethics (I5), church-state relations (I6), collectivism vs. individualism (I7), globalism vs. isolationism (I8), militarism vs. pacifism (I9), revolution vs. reform (I10) beyond a vague desire for leadership change, result vs. procedural justice (I11), or social responsibility vs. individual rights (I12).

14,"The text welcomes a UN-mediated humanitarian truce in Yemen that halts military operations and reopens Sana’a airport. This expresses support for international involvement and multilateral mechanisms (I8: Globalism) and favors a cessation of hostilities (I9: leaning toward Pacifism). No stance is given on ownership of production (I1), state structure (I2), economic system (I3), distributive equality (I4), cultural/ethical issues (I5, I7), church-state relations (I6), domestic change strategy (I10), justice orientation (I11), or personal rights vs responsibilities (I12), so these are unrelated.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0]"
15,"The text criticizes liberals for supporting bodily autonomy in abortion but not in vaccine mandates, asserting that it should be 'your body, your choice' for vaccines. This expresses a clear preference for individual autonomy over collective public health obligations, indicating Individual Right (I12=3) and an Individualist cultural value (I7=3). Although abortion is mentioned, the speaker does not take an explicit position on abortion, sexual norms, or related ethical issues, so Ethical Pursuit (I5) is not directly expressed. There is no content about economic systems (I1, I3), state structure (I2), economic equality (I4), church-state relations (I6), foreign policy (I8), militarism (I9), methods of social change (I10), or justice orientation (I11).","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
16,"The text focuses on abortion policy, praising a ban on late-term abortion and attacking Democrats as extreme on abortion. This reflects a stance favoring moral restrictions on abortion within mainstream culture, aligning with Ethical Conservatism (I5 Right). While it claims a general pro-choice identity, the endorsement of restrictions and moral framing place it on the conservative side of the ethical spectrum for this dimension. No clear positions are expressed on political regime (I1), state structure (I2), economic orientation (I3), economic equality (I4), church–state relations (I6), cultural value individualism vs collectivism (I7), diplomatic strategy (I8), military force (I9), pace of social change (I10), justice orientation (I11), or personal rights vs responsibilities (I12).","[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
17,"The text is a strategic call for persistent, wide-ranging activism: ""contest every level all the time"" and build a ""community"" to sustain ""continuous struggle."" This clearly aligns with Revolutionism (I10), favoring direct, continuous action rather than gradual change. The emphasis on drawing people into a community and collective struggle signals Collectivism (I7). Other dimensions (I1, I2, I3, I4, I5, I6, I8, I9, I11, I12) are not substantively addressed. Although it references the anti-abortion movement, it does so as a tactical example, not as an endorsement of ethical conservatism, so I5 remains unrelated.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
18,"The text challenges the idea of gender self-identification by implying it could threaten women's rights/status and urges the government to engage with the issue. This places it in the ethical/moral-cultural domain rather than economic or constitutional domains. It expresses skepticism toward self-ID (a stance more aligned with ethical conservatism in this context) and prioritizes the protection of women's collective interests over individual self-identification, indicating collectivist leanings and an emphasis on social responsibility over individual rights. There is no clear stance on political regime, state structure, economic systems or equality, church-state relations, foreign policy, militarism, social change strategy, or specific justice procedures.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2]"

20,"The text urges local advocacy to increase immigrant children's access to healthcare and safety-net programs (insurance, SNAP, WIC) and to address fears around the public charge rule. This centers on equal access (I4: emphasizes opportunity equality), promotes community responsibility for vulnerable groups (I7: collectivist), and seeks incremental, local policy/advocacy changes rather than radical overhaul (I10: reformism). It also prioritizes ensuring fair treatment and distribution of services to a marginalized group (I11: result-oriented justice) and invokes a sense of civic duty to help (I12: social responsibility).

21,"The text praises support for legislation defending a woman's right to choose, which clearly aligns with Ethical Liberalism (support for abortion rights) under I5. Framing it as a 'right to choose' emphasizes protecting individual autonomy, aligning with Individual Right (I12). The support is for legislative action, indicating a preference for institutional, reformist change rather than revolutionary means, aligning with Reformism (I10). The emphasis on personal choice also reflects Individualism in cultural values (I7).

23,"The text positively references the Inflation Reduction Act and highlights “new spending on environmental data collection” to guide federal spending on environmental issues. This implies support for government-led planning and investment in a specific policy area, touching the Economic Orientation dimension (I3), but it does not advocate a broader state-directed economy, so it is best categorized as related but centered. The change described is via standard legislative spending within existing institutions, aligning with Reformism (I10). Other dimensions—such as ownership of means of production (I1), centralism vs federalism (I2), equality (I4), social ethics (I5), church-state relations (I6), cultural values (I7), foreign policy (I8), military force (I9), justice orientation (I11), and personal rights vs responsibilities (I12)—are not addressed.","[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0]","[0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
24,"The text criticizes individuals in the gay community for expressing support for #BlackLivesMatter while simultaneously exhibiting racial exclusion in dating (“not into black guys sorry” / “it’s just a preference”). This indicates a stance emphasizing anti-discriminatory social norms over individual preference. Relevant dimensions: I4 (Econimic Equality, broadly equality across groups) is implicated because the speaker demands equal treatment of black people in social interactions, aligning with Outcome Equality. I7 (Cultural Value) is relevant as the criticism rejects purely individualistic preferences in favor of collective anti-racist norms, indicating Collectivism. I11 (Justice Orientation) applies because the focus is on fair treatment and distribution in social activities (dating), aligning with Result Justice. I12 (Personal Right) is clearly implicated: the text dismisses “it’s just a preference,” prioritizing social responsibility over individual rights to discriminate. Unrelated dimensions: I1 (Political Regime), I2 (State Structure), I3 (Economic Orientation), I5 (Ethical Pursuit regarding sexual liberation/abortion etc.), I6 (Church-State), I8 (Diplomatic Strategy), I9 (Military Force), I10 (Social Development) as the text does not address these issues.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"

Related dimensions: I4 (Economic Equality) is implicated because the concern is unequal impact and the remedy is removing procedural barriers to ensure equal access—aligned with Opportunity Equality (Right).

The mention of religious upbringing affects personal ethics rather than advocating any institutional church–state arrangement, so I6 (Church-State Relations) is unrelated. The emphasis on pro-choice pertains to individual rights, while anti-abortion reflects restriction/responsibility, making I12 (Personal Right) related but mixed; thus Center (2).

66,"The text criticizes the state compelling women to remain pregnant, emphasizing bodily autonomy and opposing coercive moral regulation. This directly signals Ethical Liberalism (I5), as it supports abortion rights. It also stresses individual autonomy over collective or potential-life considerations, indicating Individualism in cultural values (I7). Additionally, it prioritizes protecting individual rights against state coercion, aligning with Individual Right (I12).

67,"The text references #BlackLivesMatter and describes a citizen directly confronting an officer involved in George Floyd’s death after his release on bail. This signals support for a social movement seeking accountability for police violence and suggests dissatisfaction with merely procedural outcomes (e.g., bail) in favor of concrete accountability results. It also reflects direct action to pursue social goals (confrontation) and frames concern around a collective (Black lives) rather than individual-only framing. Therefore: I10 (Revolutionism) is related and left; I11 (Justice Orientation) aligns with Result Justice; I7 (Cultural Value) leans Collectivism.

It is related to Cultural Value (I7) through emphasis on collective action and community solidarity, which leans collectivism. It is related to Social Development (I10) by advocating ongoing, direct activism (“fight this fight”), which aligns with revolutionism over gradualism. It is related to Justice Orientation (I11) by centering concern for victims and equitable treatment (result-focused justice rather than solely procedural fairness).

The tension between advocating individual autonomy in reproductive decisions and collective responsibility in public health makes the cultural value dimension mixed rather than clearly individualist or collectivist, so mark it as centered but related (I7: Center). Other dimensions (I1, I2, I3, I4, I6, I8, I9, I10, I11) are not addressed in the text.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3]"

It defends a woman's right to make her own decisions, aligning with ethical liberalism on social issues like abortion (I5 Left). That same phrasing foregrounds individual autonomy, indicating an individualist cultural value (I7 Right) and a prioritization of protecting individual rights (I12 Right). The focus on unfair outcomes (inequality, unaffordable life-saving medicine) reflects a result-oriented view of justice (I11 Left). There is no clear stance on public versus private ownership (I1), state structure (I2), church-state relations (I6), foreign policy (I8), interstate militarism (I9), or revolutionary versus gradual change (I10).","[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]"

This directly engages Ethical Pursuit by supporting abortion rights (Ethical Liberalism).

The mention of equal rights for women reflects a justice orientation focused on fair treatment of groups (Result Justice). No positions are expressed on political regime, state structure, economic orientation or equality, church-state relations, diplomacy, militarism, or approaches to social change, so those are unrelated.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3]"

101,"The text is a critique of U.S. border and immigration enforcement under DHS Secretary Mayorkas, calling to end “catch and release” and to stem the flow of illegal border crossers. This expresses a nationalist, law-and-order posture prioritizing the collective interests of the “American people” over the claims of individual migrants (related to Cultural Value: Collectivism). It also implies a preference for tighter borders and reduced cross-border movement, reflecting an isolationist tendency in foreign/immigration posture (related to Diplomatic Strategy: Isolationism).

It does relate to social development strategy (I10), since building an informal network and raising awareness indicates a gradual, reformist approach rather than direct revolutionary action.

This expresses an anti-war, anti-militarist sentiment. Thus it is clearly related to I9 (Military Force) and leans toward pacifism. It also touches I8 (Diplomatic Strategy) by rejecting interventionist momentum, but it does not articulate a broader doctrine of isolationism; therefore, it is related but centered.

107,"The text criticizes certain women’s groups for ignoring evidence and defending Amber Heard, implying a preference for evidence-based fairness over group-based outcomes. This aligns with Procedural Justice (I11 Right), since the author stresses fair decisions grounded in evidence rather than protecting a group’s preferred result. It also reflects Individualism (I7 Right), rejecting collective identity claims in favor of judging individuals and equal standards regardless of group membership. Additionally, the emphasis on equality as protecting individuals’ rights (e.g., men’s right not to be assaulted) points to Individual Right (I12 Right).

The speaker rejects being treated as a stereotyped collective and emphasizes understanding what individuals actually think, which suggests a preference for individual assessments over group-based judgments—aligning with Individualism (Right) in I7.

I10 Social Development aligns with Reformism since it advocates change through petitions and civic engagement rather than revolutionary upheaval. I11 Justice Orientation aligns with Result Justice, emphasizing substantive outcomes (feeling safe and achieving justice) for specific groups rather than procedural fairness alone.

However, the text does not express approval or disapproval—it's descriptive—so the stance is center (related but neutral).

Framing it as a denial of a constitutional right also reflects Procedural Justice (I11). Calling for federal legislative action implies a preference for Centralism (I2), since WHPA would set a national standard overriding state-level restrictions. The focus on ensuring access across groups points to Opportunity Equality (I4), emphasizing equal access rather than equal outcomes.

This centers on protecting individual rights (I12) and equal access/opportunity (I4). The moral framing aligns with ethical liberalism (I5) by advocating women’s rights and gender equality. It also reflects an individualist cultural value (I7) by prioritizing individual rights over restrictive social norms. The focus on concrete harms and unfair outcomes to women and girls indicates a result-oriented sense of justice (I11).

However, it does not clearly endorse or oppose abortion rights; saying 'it is about much more than that' signals broader considerations without specifying a stance, so it is related but indeterminate (center). It also touches on the framing of individual rights (I12), but again without a clear prioritization of individual rights over social responsibility or vice versa, so marked as related but center.

It emphasizes “standing up for the rule of law,” indicating a focus on legal procedures over redistributive outcomes (I11 Procedural Justice). The border-security framing relates to foreign interaction preferences: favoring tighter borders and reduced cross-border flows aligns with Isolationism (I8). The stress on collective safety and compliance with law over individual liberties points to Social Responsibility (I12).

This directly reflects Ethical Liberalism (I5) as it supports abortion rights and liberal social values. It emphasizes protecting individual rights (“rights taken away,” “reproductive rights”), aligning with Individual Right (I12). The strategy to achieve goals is through electoral politics and federal legislation (“deliver a pro-choice majority Congress,” “codify Roe”), indicating Reformism (I10) rather than direct revolutionary action. Because it seeks a federal law to establish uniform abortion rights, it implies a preference for centralized authority over state-by-state variation, aligning with Centralism (I2).

The rest of the dimensions—political regime (I1), state structure (I2), economic orientation (I3), economic equality (I4), church-state relations (I6), cultural value (I7), diplomatic strategy (I8), military force (I9), social development (I10), justice orientation (I11), and personal right (I12)—are not addressed by the text.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
198,"The text focuses on economic policy in response to an energy price crisis, urging the Johnson government to reduce taxes on energy and impose a windfall tax on energy companies. This is related to Economic Orientation (I3), Economic Equality (I4), Social Development (I10), and Justice Orientation (I11). For I3, the stance reflects a mixed, interventionist approach within a market system—using taxation (state action) but not advocating comprehensive government control over economic decisions—thus center. For I4, the emphasis is on distributive outcomes (lower bills for consumers and capturing excess corporate profits), aligning with Outcome Equality. For I10, the call is for immediate policy reforms through governmental mechanisms, which indicates Reformism rather than revolutionary change. For I11, the focus is on achieving fair outcomes (affordable energy) rather than procedural fairness, aligning with Result Justice. Dimensions unrelated or not evidenced include Political Regime (I1), State Structure (I2), Ethical Pursuit (I5), Church-State Relations (I6), Cultural Value (I7), Diplomatic Strategy (I8), Military Force (I9), and Personal Right (I12), as the text does not address ownership models, power distribution, moral or religious issues, cultural individualism/collectivism, foreign policy, militarism, or personal rights/responsibilities.","[0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0]","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

The appeal centers on outcomes—well-being of women and alignment with majority preferences—rather than on procedural legitimacy, which aligns with Result Justice (I11). The emphasis on personal autonomy and 'choice' also reflects Cultural Value (I7) leaning toward Individualism.

Proposing to alter legislative procedure to secure a specific policy outcome reflects a Result‑Justice orientation (I11).

The emphasis on personal autonomy (“Never had kids and never will” and defending a woman's right to choose) reflects Individualism (I7) and prioritizing Individual Rights over social duties (I12).

While the hashtag “RussianWarCrimes” references justice, the text does not articulate a stance on result versus procedural justice, so I11 is considered unrelated.

This implies a stance favoring equal access to participation regardless of religious attire, highlighting individual civil liberties. Therefore, it relates to Economic Equality (I4) on the side of Opportunity Equality and Personal Right (I12) on the side of protecting individual rights. It also reflects Individualism (I7) by prioritizing the individual's right to choose religious dress while accessing public roles.

Substantively, it is personally pro-choice for adult women with a mid-pregnancy limit and medical/parental involvement later for minors—this blends liberal permissiveness with some restrictions, placing it between Ethical Liberalism and Conservatism (I5: Center). The emphasis on adult women's autonomy ('no questions asked' for those over 18) reflects a prioritization of individual rights (I12: Individual Right) and a culturally individualist framing (I7: Individualism).

This strongly emphasizes protecting individual freedoms (free access to information/speech), aligning with Individual Right (I12) and an Individualist cultural value (I7) against state-imposed collective control. It also advocates cross-border engagement to aid people in another country, reflecting a globalist orientation (I8). The call for immediate, concrete action by individuals to achieve a social goal (circumvent censorship) reflects a revolutionist/direct-action stance (I10).

The emphasis is on tangible outcomes for women and children rather than procedural fairness, indicating Result Justice (I11). Regarding Personal Right (I12), the text simultaneously defends a woman's bodily autonomy (individual rights) and calls for collective responsibility to protect children, yielding a mixed, centrist signal. Similarly for Cultural Value (I7), it criticizes prioritizing others' ""freedoms"" over communal care while also emphasizing individual autonomy, so a centrist assessment fits.

This positions the speaker against permissive norms around gender/sexual expression and aligns with a culturally conservative stance on ethical/social issues (I5). It also emphasizes protecting women's rights and boundaries—framed as rights not to be coerced—indicating a prioritization of individual/group rights over duties (I12). There is no discussion of economic systems (I1, I3, I4), state structure (I2), church-state relations (I6), broader cultural value orientation (I7) beyond the specific gender-rights context, foreign policy (I8), military force (I9), pace of social change (I10), or justice orientation (I11), so those are unrelated.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3]"

It relates to Ethical Pursuit (I5) because the speaker frames the issue in terms of sexism and defends young women against moralistic judgment, reflecting a socially liberal/feminist stance. It also touches Justice Orientation (I11): by endorsing the idea of ""balancing things up"" and criticizing demands for accountability in this specific case, the speaker signals a result-oriented view that prioritizes perceived distributive fairness over strict procedural accountability.

The only arguably related dimension is Military Force (I9): the context involves interstate violence, and the subject’s reaction indicates opposition to this particular use of force, but it does not generalize to a principled pacifist stance.

It is related to foreign policy (I8) by framing events in an international context and considering implications for Warsaw/NATO, reflecting a globalist perspective.

This clearly reflects a globalist orientation (I8) through support for international alignment and a multipolar world, and it signals a revolutionary approach (I10) by endorsing active resistance and systemic replacement rather than gradual change. It references warfare and a necessary fightback, making the stance on military force related but ambiguous (I9): it neither explicitly endorses strong armed force nor espouses pacifism. Other dimensions (I1, I2, I3, I4, I5, I6, I7, I11, I12) are not addressed: there is no clear position on property ownership, state structure, economic planning, equality models, cultural/ethical issues, church-state relations, individual vs collective primacy at the societal level, justice conception, or personal rights.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

It also implicates the Personal Right vs Social Responsibility axis (I12) because abortion policy centers on bodily autonomy versus protecting fetal life; again, no explicit stance is expressed, so center.

Emphasis on queuing, “wait your turn,” and rule-following indicates a focus on fair procedures (I11 Procedural Justice). The insistence on taking only as many as the country can afford and restricting admissions over individual claims underscores social responsibility over individual rights (I12 Social Responsibility). The call for a single, direct, large-scale action (“build a massive border wall”) suggests a preference for decisive, noticeable action rather than gradual change (I10 Revolutionism).

The emphasis on guaranteed outcomes (e.g., feeding children) also reflects Result Justice (I11). The language centers on rights, especially the woman's right to choose, which aligns with an emphasis on Individual Rights over duties (I12).

The provision of free refugee transport and emphasis on collective action suggest prioritizing social responsibility over individual rights (I12). On economic orientation (I3), the stance rejects a pure market logic (free services, collective control) but does not advocate state command planning; thus it is related but neither command nor market-dominant.

Mentions of 'Ukraine', 'USA', and 'Russia' are contextual and do not establish a stance on diplomatic entanglements or international policy design (I8), so that dimension remains unrelated.

The text does not address or take positions on political regime (I1), state structure (I2), economic equality (I4), ethical issues (I5), church-state relations (I6), cultural values (I7), military force (I9), social development strategy (I10), justice orientation (I11), or personal rights vs responsibilities (I12).","[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

That focus on individual autonomy also reflects Cultural Value (I7) toward Individualism. Mentions of bombing/shooting are condemnations of domestic violent activism, but they do not address interstate military force, so Military Force (I9) is unrelated.

The quoted focus on teaching young women to budget and cook is framed as prescriptive, traditional gender-role moralizing, which the speaker mocks. This implies support for women’s autonomy and opposition to restrictive cultural norms. Related dimensions: I5 (Ethical Pursuit) aligns with Ethical Liberalism (criticizing conservative prescriptions for women’s behavior); I12 (Personal Right) leans toward protecting individual rights over mandated social responsibilities; I7 (Cultural Value) suggests Individualism—prioritizing individual choice over collective, traditional roles.

Emphasis on aiding workers/hospitals reflects a distributive, outcome-focused fairness, aligning with Economic Equality (I4) toward Outcome Equality. The explicit call for transparency and accountability ties to Justice Orientation (I11) through procedural concerns, while the distributive emphasis also reflects result justice; overall this suggests a mixed stance, best captured as center on I11.

The mention of aggression and security is related to the use of military force (I9), but the text neither endorses militaristic solutions nor expresses pacifism, so it is centered/neutral there.

It also frames values in terms of societal health over corporate interests, indicating a collectivist orientation (I7).

The call to ""Vote blue"" to affect policy change indicates a preference for change through electoral/legislative channels, which aligns with Reformism (I10). The mention of Roe v.

The argument frames justice as equalizing outcomes (“Why not men’s?”), pointing to Result Justice (I11).

This reflects support for private enterprise and corporate governance rather than public ownership, tying to Capitalism (I1). It favors market-oriented mechanisms and business-led improvements over state-directed planning, indicating a Market Economy (I3). The focus on sovereign food security alongside recognition of global supply chain issues suggests concern for domestic resilience while engaging with international dynamics, a balanced stance under Diplomatic Strategy (I8, Center). The call to adopt ESG is an institutional, incremental change rather than a radical overhaul, aligning with Reformism (I10).

- I2 (State Structure) is unrelated: no reference to centralism vs federalism.
- I3 (Economic Orientation) is related but not clearly left or right: the critique implies desire for stronger government action/regulation (climate, inequality, pandemic), but does not endorse a full command economy; thus center.

This makes several dimensions relevant: Ethical Pursuit (I5) is implicated because the stance aligns with culturally liberal, progressive social movements, suggesting Ethical Liberalism. Social Development (I10) is relevant due to clear sympathy with direct-action protest movements, indicating Revolutionism. Economic Equality (I4) is touched by #ows (concern about inequality), but the text does not specify preference for outcome vs opportunity equality, so it’s related but neutral.

I12 (Personal Right) is clearly engaged by prioritizing protection of individual rights (“a right which can't be abridged”), though it also calls for shared responsibility; the dominant emphasis remains on individual rights. I11 (Justice Orientation) leans toward Procedural Justice because it frames equality as a right safeguarded by fair rules and protections rather than redistribution of outcomes.

This indicates support for abortion rights and liberal social norms, mapping to Ethical Pursuit (I5) on the left (ethical liberalism). The evaluation focuses on harmful consequences (women losing rights) rather than legal or procedural considerations, aligning with Result Justice (I11) on the left. The critique of mainstream feminism prioritizing gender identity over sex-based rights is a cultural critique but does not clearly map to other listed dimensions.

1266,"The input references a wartime video supposedly from the Ukrainian Armed Forces and labels the content as ""crimes against humanity,"" focusing on alleged abuses in the context of armed conflict. This directly engages the Military Force dimension (I9) because it discusses wartime actions and condemns specific violent conduct. However, it does not advocate for the use of strong armed forces (militarism) nor declare all interstate violence inherently wrong (pacifism); it is a criticism of particular actions rather than a comprehensive stance on military force, so I9 is related but neutral (2). The derogatory reference to ""Bolshevik"" does not present a coherent position on socialism vs capitalism (I1) or other dimensions. There is no explicit stance on state structure, economic orientation, equality, ethical issues, church-state relations, cultural values, diplomatic strategy, social change methods, justice orientation, or personal rights beyond a general human-rights framing; these dimensions lack clear ideological content here and are marked as unrelated (0).","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]","[3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

I7 (Cultural Value) is expressed via emphasis on communal identity and solidarity over partisan labels, indicating collectivism. I12 (Personal Right) is reflected in urging behavioral changes (online services) for the common good, prioritizing social responsibility over individual preferences. I10 (Social Development) shows preference for pragmatic, incremental changes in practice rather than radical upheaval, aligning with reformism.

The statement about not operating in isolation clearly aligns with globalism (I8). The focus on individual rights over collective or religious dictates indicates individualism (I7).

There is no explicit stance on militarism vs. pacifism (I9); sympathy for victims does not equate to a clear position on the use of military force.

This also suggests a broader cultural tilt toward Individualism (I7), prioritizing personal autonomy over collective moral prescriptions.

On Economic Equality (I4), the emphasis is on equal rights and access rather than redistribution of outcomes, aligning with Opportunity Equality. Ethical Pursuit (I5) is related because it supports liberal social values around rights and freedom, aligning with Ethical Liberalism.

The slogan “No one is free when others are oppressed” frames the issue in terms of collective solidarity, indicating a collectivist orientation (I7), and emphasizes substantive outcomes/freedom rather than deference to procedural authority, aligning with Result Justice (I11). The act of public protest constitutes direct, noticeable action to drive social change, reflecting Revolutionism (I10).

The mention of racism touches on equality concerns but does not specify whether equality of outcome or opportunity is preferred, so Economic Equality (I4) is related but indeterminate (center).

I8 Diplomatic Strategy is implicated because onshoring and securing domestic supply chains to enhance national security suggests reducing reliance on international entanglements—an isolationist tilt (label 3). I10 Social Development is implicated since the change is pursued through formal legislation and planned investment rather than direct disruptive action, reflecting reformism (label 3).

These points relate to Ethical Pursuit (I5) in favor of Ethical Liberalism and to Political Regime (I1) with an anti-capitalist tone.

This clearly aligns with Ethical Liberalism (I5). The call to defeat him in the 2022 election indicates pursuit of social change through electoral, incremental means rather than radical upheaval, aligning with Reformism (I10). The assertion that women are not objects implies a focus on protecting individual autonomy and rights, consistent with Individual Right (I12).

It also critiques market-based health arrangements and calls for stronger government responsibility in key public health decisions, aligning with a command-oriented stance in economic policy during crises (I3).

It strongly emphasizes bodily autonomy and protection of individual rights, making Personal Right (I12) lean toward Individual Right. The cultural framing centers on individual autonomy over moral restrictions, so Cultural Value (I7) leans toward Individualism, despite collective phrasing.

Related dimensions: I5 Ethical Pursuit is implicated through focus on sexual ethics and women's rights, but the text does not explicitly advocate liberal policies like sexual liberation, same-sex marriage, or abortion, nor moral-religious restriction; thus marked as related but center. I12 Personal Right is clearly emphasized by defending women's individual rights against non-consensual behavior, aligning with Individual Right. I11 Justice Orientation leans toward outcome-focused accountability (“your time will come” and “you will be disgraced”), indicating Result Justice rather than procedural fairness.

1784,"The text criticizes conservatives for celebrating the overturning of Roe (implying support for abortion rights) while opposing universal health care. This reveals stances on several dimensions: I5 Ethical Pursuit leans Ethical Liberalism because support for abortion rights aligns with liberal social values. I12 Personal Right emphasizes protecting individual rights (a woman's right to choose), indicating Individual Right. The endorsement of universal health care suggests I3 Command Economy tendencies (greater government role in key social services) and I4 Outcome Equality (aiming for equal access to healthcare for all). It also implies I7 Collectivism by favoring collective provision/responsibility for healthcare.

It leans toward Globalism (I8=1) because it suggests reconsidering business ties in light of an international conflict rather than avoiding entanglement (Isolationism).

The author prioritizes substantive policy outcomes over adherence to procedural rules, calling the filibuster a harmful 'relic', which aligns with Result Justice (I11). The call to remove or bypass the filibuster to quickly enact significant legislation indicates a preference for direct, noticeable action to achieve social goals, i.e., Revolutionism (I10). On Personal Right (I12), the message is mixed: it supports protecting voting and women's rights (individual rights) while supporting gun reform (often framed as social responsibility), so a centered/mixed stance fits.

1789,"The text comments on a cultural/ethical controversy around JK Rowling's advocacy for women, sex-based rights, and single-sex spaces, criticizing Major League Quidditch for distancing itself from that stance. This directly reflects Ethical Pursuit (I5), aligning with Ethical Conservatism by favoring traditional boundaries around sex/gender and restrictions on access to single-sex spaces over more progressive, inclusion-oriented norms. The text also emphasizes rights (""support for women, sex-based rights""), which indicates a focus on protecting rights rather than emphasizing responsibilities, making Personal Right (I12) related and leaning toward Individual Right.

This indicates: ethical liberalism (support for progressive social rights and norms) in I5; a pro-Enlightenment, likely secular stance in I6; emphasis on rights consistent with individualism (I7) and prioritizing individual rights (I12). The reference to rights movements suggests a focus on equal access/opportunity rather than enforced equal outcomes (I4).

The emphasis on respecting institutions and democratic procedures aligns with procedural justice (I11). Favoring institutional, brokered peace over bypassing processes suggests reformism rather than direct revolutionary action (I10). The support for peace brokers indicates a preference for negotiated resolution, but it does not explicitly reject all use of force, so military stance is related but indeterminate (I9, center).

No clear positions are expressed on political regime (I1), state structure (I2), economic equality (I4), ethical issues (I5), church–state relations (I6), cultural values (I7), militarism/pacifism (I9), social change strategy (I10), justice orientation (I11), or personal rights vs responsibilities (I12).","[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

This aligns with Ethical Liberalism (I5, Left) because it supports abortion rights as part of liberal ethical norms. The emphasis on personal autonomy and privacy maps to Personal Right (I12, Individual Right, Right).

The call to “build our own party” advocates direct, noticeable change outside the existing system, aligning with Revolutionism in Social Development (I10).

The emphasis on rights and inclusion reflects a broadly socially liberal stance. It does not address property ownership (I1), state structure (I2), economic planning (I3), church–state relations (I6), foreign policy (I8), or interstate military force (I9).

This focus on personal autonomy also reflects Cultural Value (I7) favoring Individualism (Right). The call for pro-choice men to 'speak up' advocates immediate, direct activism rather than gradual change, indicating Social Development (I10) leaning toward Revolutionism (Left).

This directly relates to Social Development (I10), favoring Revolutionism over Reformism, as it implies the need for proactive, direct action rather than trusting gradual institutional processes. It also relates to Justice Orientation (I11), favoring Result Justice over Procedural Justice by prioritizing preventing harmful outcomes (fascist takeover) over trusting institutional procedures. The text does not address ownership of the means of production (I1), state structure (I2), economic orientation (I3), economic equality (I4), ethical issues (I5), church-state relations (I6), cultural individualism/collectivism (I7), foreign policy (I8), use of military force (I9), or personal rights vs social responsibility (I12), so those are unrelated.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

This directly relates to Social Development (I10), as it calls for change through formal amendment—a reformist approach—despite the urgent tone. It strongly implicates Justice Orientation (I11) by prioritizing outcomes for victims over procedural time limits, aligning with Result Justice. It also relates to Personal Right (I12) by emphasizing victims’ ability (a right) to seek justice regardless of elapsed time, thus privileging protection of individual rights.

This directly touches the Military Force dimension (I9), signaling disapproval of aggressive military action. However, it does not endorse a comprehensive pacifist stance (e.g., opposing all interstate violence) nor advocate for militaristic solutions; thus, it is best coded as related but centrist. Other dimensions (I1–I8, I10–I12) are not substantively addressed: there is no discussion of ownership models, state structure, economic policy, equality, ethics, religion-state relations, cultural values, foreign policy strategy, social change approaches, justice framework, or personal rights versus responsibilities.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]"

It emphasizes protecting individual privacy and bodily autonomy, aligning with Individual Right (I12, Right) and broader Individualism in cultural values (I7, Right). The appeal to protect constitutional rights indicates a focus on legal and procedural safeguards, consistent with Procedural Justice (I11, Right). The call for congressional legislative action reflects pursuing change through institutional reform rather than radical action, aligning with Reformism (I10, Right).

It emphasizes women's autonomy against moral control, prioritizing individual rights (I12-Right) and cultural individualism over collective moral norms (I7-Right). The call to fund sex education, child care, and birth control suggests expanding access to resources, which aligns with opportunity equality rather than enforced equal outcomes (I4-Right). The critique of using religiously framed ‘morality’ to dictate policy implies support for separation of religion and state (I6-Left).

Justice Orientation (I11) is implicated by urging authorities to make fair licensing decisions for DACA recipients, reflecting procedural justice. Personal Right (I12) is emphasized through protecting individuals’ ability to obtain licenses and pursue careers. Cultural Value (I7) leans toward individualism by centering individual immigrant youths’ career pursuits, though it also notes collective benefits; the primary thrust is enabling individual opportunity. References to “states like Arkansas” are descriptive and do not present a normative stance on State Structure (I2).

It emphasizes collective safety and social guarantees (""guaranteed safety from shooters,"" ""being able to afford healthcare"") over individual gun rights, reflecting Collectivism (I7) and Social Responsibility (I12). The call for rights to safety and healthcare implies a preference for state action and social guarantees, suggesting a left-leaning Economic Orientation (I3) and Outcome Equality (I4). The focus on ensuring outcomes (safety, healthcare access) aligns with Result Justice (I11).

It also emphasizes collective welfare through support for health care, child care, school lunches, gun safety, and protecting the planet, indicating a collectivist value orientation (I7) and prioritizing social responsibility over absolute individual rights (I12). The statement does not address ownership of the means of production (I1), state structure (I2), macroeconomic decision-making (I3), a specific theory of equality (I4), explicit church-state relations (I6), foreign policy/global engagement (I8), military force (I9), the pace or method of social change (I10), or a procedural vs result-based theory of justice (I11), so those are unrelated.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
1877,"The text criticizes a self-described 'Pro-Life' figure for ignoring mass shooting victims, framing this as moral hypocrisy. 'Pro-Life' aligns with Ethical Conservatism, and the author’s disapproval implies a stance closer to Ethical Liberalism (I5). No clear positions are stated on political regime (I1), state structure (I2), economic orientation (I3), economic equality (I4), church-state relations (I6), cultural value (I7), diplomatic strategy (I8), military force (I9), social development (I10), justice orientation (I11), or personal rights vs responsibilities (I12).","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
1878,"The text criticizes police actions during protests, framing arrests as an attempted intimidation tactic that is failing, and uses the hashtag #revolt. This implies support for protest and direct action (I10: Revolutionism). The disapproval of using arrests to create a chilling effect suggests opposition to coercive force to achieve political ends, leaning toward pacifism/anti-militarized policing (I9: Pacifism). The tone also implies support for the right to protest against state suppression, emphasizing individual rights (I12: Individual Right). There is no clear content about economic systems (I1, I3), state structure (I2), equality frameworks (I4), ethical social issues (I5), church-state relations (I6), collectivism vs individualism (I7), foreign policy (I8), or justice orientation in terms of procedures vs outcomes (I11), so these are unrelated.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 3]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
1879,"The text is a critique of U.S. immigration and border policy under the Biden Administration, expressing that current messaging encourages migrants to come and framing this as a failure. This indicates a preference for stricter border control and reduced cross-border openness, which aligns with Isolationism under Diplomatic Strategy (I8). The text does not address ownership of production (I1), state structure (I2), economic decision-making models (I3), economic equality (I4), social/ethical issues like marriage or abortion (I5), church-state relations (I6), cultural individualism vs collectivism (I7), use of military force (I9), approaches to social change (I10), justice frameworks (I11), or personal rights vs responsibilities (I12) in any explicit way, so those dimensions are unrelated.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]"
1880,"The text is a fundraising appeal from a Georgia state senator who identifies explicitly as a pro-choice physician legislator. This clearly signals a stance on Ethical Pursuit (I5), supporting abortion rights and aligning with ethical liberalism. The term “pro-choice” also emphasizes bodily autonomy and the protection of individual decision-making, relating to Personal Right (I12) and aligning with an emphasis on individual rights. No explicit positions are expressed about political/economic systems (I1, I3, I4), state structure (I2), church-state relations (I6), broader cultural collectivism vs individualism (I7), foreign policy (I8), use of military force (I9), strategy of social change (I10), or justice orientation (I11), so these are unrelated.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
1881,"The text condemns anti-abortion activists for deceptive, anonymous mass texts about an abortion amendment. This clearly signals a pro-choice stance, aligning with Ethical Liberalism (I5). The emphasis on anonymity being a “federal violation” and the deception affecting voting indicates a concern for legal compliance, transparency, and fair process, aligning with Procedural Justice (I11). Referring to “pro-choice” implies prioritizing individual reproductive autonomy, supporting Individual Right (I12). Other dimensions (I1, I2, I3, I4, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10) are not addressed in the text.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3]"
1882,"The text celebrates the destruction of enemy forces and portrays violence against Russians as pleasurable, clearly endorsing the use of strong armed force to achieve objectives. This directly relates to I9 (Military Force) and aligns with militarism (Left label for this dimension). The post does not address economic systems (I1, I3), state structure (I2), equality (I4), ethical issues (I5), church-state relations (I6), cultural values (I7) in terms of collectivism/individualism, diplomatic strategy (I8) beyond mentioning the war without a stance on globalism vs isolationism, social development approaches (I10), justice orientation (I11), or personal rights vs responsibilities (I12).

1883,"The text is a brief, factual report about a military development in the Russia–Ukraine war, mentioning Ukrainian forces cutting Russian supply lines near Kyiv. It contains no evaluative or normative statements about economic systems, state structure, equality, ethics, religion-state relations, cultural values, diplomacy, militarism vs. pacifism, social change strategy, justice, or personal rights. Even though it references military action, it does not express a stance for or against the use of force, so no ideological position is revealed on I9 either.

1884,"The text consists of a Vatican editorial director urging anti-abortion activists to broaden their concern to other threats to life (easy access to guns, poverty, rising maternal mortality) and a separate sarcastic remark (“On this, the Holy Day of Pissing Up A Rope…”). The first quote directly engages Ethical Pursuit (I5) because it references abortion, but it does not clearly endorse abortion rights or call for stricter prohibitions; rather, it promotes a consistent-life ethic that spans multiple issues. This makes the stance related but mixed, so marked as Center (I5=2). It also implies a prioritization of communal welfare and responsibility (concern for public safety and social conditions) over individual prerogatives (e.g., gun access), which aligns with Social Responsibility (I12=1). The sarcastic “Holy Day” line suggests irreverence toward religion but does not articulate any position on church-state relations. No clear positions are stated on the other dimensions: property regime (I1), state structure (I2), economic orientation (I3), equality type (I4), church-state relations (I6), cultural value (I7), foreign policy (I8), military force (I9), pace of social change (I10), or justice orientation (I11).","[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]"
1885,"The input is mainly a set of hashtags about the NATO–Russia war, with explicit anti-war sentiments (#NoToWar, #StopNuclearWar), which indicates a pacifist stance under Military Force (I9: Pacifism). The hashtag #InternationalWorkersRevolution signals support for socialist politics (I1: Socialism), a revolutionary approach to social change (I10: Revolutionism), and a collectivist orientation (I7: Collectivism). The emphasis on international workers and references to multiple countries suggest an international/global perspective rather than isolationism (I8: Globalism). There is no clear content regarding state structure (centralism vs federalism), economic decision-making (command vs market), equality type (outcome vs opportunity), ethical/cultural issues, church-state relations, justice orientation, or personal rights; these dimensions are treated as unrelated.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]"
1886,"The text criticizes a government for making and selectively enforcing a ""draconian"" law, causing suffering while officials themselves likely broke it, and rejects using Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a distraction from police findings. This indicates emphasis on civil liberties against heavy-handed state action (related to I12: Individual Right) and a demand for due process and institutional accountability (related to I11: Procedural Justice). No clear positions are expressed on political regime (I1), state structure (I2), economic orientation (I3), economic equality (I4), ethical liberalism/conservatism (I5), church-state relations (I6), cultural collectivism/individualism beyond general civil liberties (insufficient for I7), diplomatic strategy (I8), militarism/pacifism (I9), or preferred mode of social change (I10).","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3]","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]"
1887,"The text is a brief news-like statement about Alberta's oil and gas sector experiencing a labor shortage as demand and growth rebound. It describes market dynamics (companies, demand, sector growth) without advocating government planning or specific market-based policies, making it related to Economic Orientation but neutral. No content addresses ownership models (I1), state power distribution (I2), equality frameworks (I4), ethical/social issues (I5), church-state relations (I6), cultural values (I7), foreign policy (I8), military (I9), strategies for social change (I10), justice frameworks (I11), or rights vs responsibilities (I12).","[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
1888,"The text is a campaign-style endorsement urging the reelection of a candidate, highlighting support for women’s reproductive rights and priorities like affordable healthcare and better education, and calling for donating/volunteering. Related dimensions: I5 Ethical Pursuit is clearly addressed by supporting reproductive rights, which aligns with Ethical Liberalism (Left/1). I12 Personal Right is implicated in two directions: explicit emphasis on individual rights (women’s reproductive rights) and also social provision goals (affordable healthcare, improving education), yielding a mixed emphasis and thus Center/2. I3 Economic Orientation is tangentially related because “making healthcare affordable” suggests some public intervention, but the mechanism (state command vs market) is unspecified, so Center/2. I10 Social Development is related because the text advocates change through electoral and volunteer action, indicating Reformism (Right/3). Unrelated or not explicitly addressed: I1 Political Regime, I2 State Structure, I4 Economic Equality, I6 Church-State Relations, I7 Cultural Value (beyond the rights claim, no explicit collectivism/individualism framing), I8 Diplomatic Strategy, I9 Military Force, and I11 Justice Orientation.","[0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 2]","[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3]"
